1. what the homework was about in your own words?
In this notebook, I have analyazed the hypothesis that "The proportion of men 
biking more than 30 minus is less than the proportion of women biking more than 30 minutes". 

This analysis has been implemented by following steps:
(1) create null/alternative hypothesis; setting a significance level $\alpha=0.05$
(2) visualization data; evaluating the distribution of women/men hiking minutes; 
the histogram of biking length by gender;plot the fraction of normalized biking length by gender
(3) using z test to deny null pothesis; check the effect size
