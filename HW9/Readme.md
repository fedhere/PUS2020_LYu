This figure above is the Log10 Median Household Income in Los Angeles County. However, it is hard to see the location and the details.

I have used California state map as the base map. It could help the reader understand the location of LA county. But it is still hard to see the income distribution.

I narrowed the income distribution map and it shows that the northeast of LA county has the lowest median household income, and the southwest of LA county has the highest median household income.
