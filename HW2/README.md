# 1. what the homework was about in your own words?
# In this notebook, I have looked at the size distribution of parks in Pilly by calculating the mean value, median value, and made a histogram. 
The mean value(23.2) is unequal to the median value(3.6), which means park size data could be positive skew, which has a few relatively high values.
Moreover, the histogram has proved out thinking that which overall the distribution of Pilly parks size is positive skew and the mass of the distribution
is concentrated on the left of the figure. Thus, overall in Pilly, only a small portion of parks' size are larger than 250 acres. Furthermore, I have visualized 
the distribution of parks'size less than 10 acres. In this histogram, mean value is larger than the median value, which means the overall distribution of Pilly 
parks'size(less than 10 acres) is positive skew and the mass of the distribution(the distribution of Pilly parks' size) is concentrated on the left of the figure. 
It has a few relatively high values. In the end, I have made a plot to see the difference between the distribution of the Pilly "parent" parks' size(the parks 
listed in each row in original dataset are in some cases subsets of larger parks) and the Pilly parks' size. In the distribution of the Pilly "parent" parks' size plot,
Mean value is still larger than the median but it has relative more high values than before.
