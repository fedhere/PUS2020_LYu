1. what the homework was about in your own words?
Firstly, I have read in electoral precinct geojson file in geopandas and voter turnout data.
By merging the turnout data with the electoral map, i have plot coropleth maps
of the population by electoral precinct, votes by precinct, and people density.
Secondly, Then i have plotted the correlation matrix and see the population and vores have the high correlationship. 
Thirdly, I have fitted a line model to the data and a polynomial of second degree.
I set up the problem as a machine leraning problem by splitting the sample into training and test data(test size = 0.25)
and evaluating the model on both sets. Since for both training and testing data,
model 2 has lower MAE value compated to the model 1. It indicates that model 2 might have better performance than model 1.
Then, I have plot the model over the data and also make an influce plot for each model. 
At last, i have compared the models with the Likelihood Ration test 
and the result indicates that the more complex model is better when evaluating the relationship between population and votes in DE.

2. who you worked with
I worked this assignment on my own.
