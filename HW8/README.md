1. what the homework was about in your own words?

In my analysis, I will use the same data and run a Random Forest (RF) Regressor to predict the total energy consumption. 
Then, I would like to plot the features sorted by their importance and identify the most important features.

2. who you worked with
I worked this assignment with Kyungmin. 

3. All the data coding and plotting 
(Lan and I discuss together about the data selection and data preprocessing and support each others when we have problems. 
Although the result is different since we preprocess the dataframes by ourselves, the data sources and the process of analysis are basically same.)
